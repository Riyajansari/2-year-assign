          <li>The Army of India was raised under the British Raj in the 19th century by taking the erstwhile presidency
            armies, merging them, and bringing them under the Crown. The British Indian Army fought in both World Wars
            <br> The British Indian Army was a critical force for maintaining the primacy of the British Empire, both in
            India and throughout the world. Besides maintaining the internal security of the British Raj, the Army
            fought in many other theatres: the Anglo-Burmese Wars; the First and Second Anglo-Sikh wars; the First,
            Second, and Third Anglo-Afghan wars; the First and Second opium wars, and the Boxer Rebellion in China; and
            in Abyssinia.

            Army Day is celebrated on 15 January every year in India, in recognition of Lieutenant General K. M.
            Cariappa's taking over as the first commander-in-chief of the Indian Army from General Sir Francis Butcher,
            the last British commander-in-chief of India, on 15 January 1949. With effect from 26 January 1950, the date
            India became a republic, all active-duty Indian Army officers formerly holding the King's Commission were
            recommissioned and confirmed in their substantive ranks

          <li>In 1998, India carried out nuclear tests; and a few days later, Pakistan responded with nuclear tests of
            its own, giving both countries nuclear deterrence capability, although India had tested a hydrogen bomb,
            which Pakistan lacked. Diplomatic tensions eased after the Lahore Summit was held in 1999. However, the
            sense of optimism was short-lived. In mid-1999, Pakistani paramilitary forces and Kashmiri insurgents
            captured the deserted, but strategic, Himalayan heights in the Kargil district of India. These had been
            vacated by the Indian Army during the onset of the inhospitable winter and were to be reoccupied in spring.
            The troops that took control of these areas received important support, of both arms and supplies, from
            Pakistan. Some of the heights under their control, which also included the Tiger Hill, overlooked the vital
            Srinagar–Leh Highway (NH 1A), Batalik, and Dras.

            Once the scale of the Pakistani incursion was realised, the Indian Army quickly mobilised about 200,000
            troops, and Operation Vijay was launched. However, since the heights were under Pakistani control, India was
            at a clear strategic disadvantage. From their observation posts, the Pakistani forces had a clear
            line-of-sight to lay down indirect artillery fire on NH 1A, inflicting heavy casualties on the Indians.[70]
            This was a serious problem for the Indian Army as the highway was its main supply route.[71] Thus, the
            Indian Army's first priority was to recapture peaks that were in the immediate vicinity of NH 1A. This
            resulted in Indian troops first targeting the Tiger Hill and Tololing complex in Dras.[72] This was soon
            followed by more attacks on the Batalik–Turtok sub-sector, which provided access to Siachen Glacier. Point
            4590, which had the nearest view of the NH 1A, was successfully recaptured by Indian forces on 14 June</li>

            <h4>2016 Surgical Strikes on Kashmir and the 2016–2018 India-Pakistan conflict</h4>
            On 18 September 2016, a fedayeen attack was made by four armed militants on an army base near the town of
            Uri. Nineteen Indian Army soldiers were killed. India accused Jaish-e-Muhammad, a Pakistan-based terrorist
            organisation.[79] On 29 September 2016, the India Army announced that it conducted "surgical strikes"
            against militant launch pads across the Line of Control, in Pakistani-administered Kashmir, and inflicted
            "significant casualties".[80] Indian media reported the casualty figures variously from 35 to 70
            killed.[81][82] Partial footage of the strikes was released to the Indian media on 27 June 2018 as proof of
            the strike.[83][84][85] The incident triggered the 2016–2018 India-Pakistan border conflict, which ended on
            16 June 2018 with both India and Pakistan agreeing on a ceasefire.
